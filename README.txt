Hello everyone,

Please try and place your content in the correct folders. (i.e. images, css, js, 
and php  going into the assets folder then into their respective folder). Make sure
to consult everyone before you make any large changes, comment your code, and
add meaningful commit messages to keep everyone in the loop.

Thanks,
Innocenzio Rizzuto
